# Stock Price Prediction Challenge

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict stock closing prices 5 trading days into the future using historical stock data spanning from 1980 to 2005. The solution includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation through both statistical metrics and simulated trading.

## Approach Summary

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned missing values and zero entries in the dataset
- Converted date strings to datetime format for proper time series analysis
- Set the appropriate index for time series operations
- Handled outliers through statistical detection methods

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyzed long-term price trends, identifying key growth phases over the 25-year period
- Examined return distributions to understand volatility patterns
- Investigated trading volume relationships with price movements
- Decomposed time series to identify trend, seasonality, and anomaly components
- Identified significant market events reflected in the data (e.g., 1987 crash, dot-com bubble)

### Feature Engineering

- Created technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Developed momentum indicators (price changes over various time horizons)
- Constructed volatility measures (ATR, rolling standard deviation)
- Added volume-based features (volume ratios, price-volume relationships)
- Incorporated temporal features to capture day-of-week and monthly effects

### Model Selection

- Evaluated multiple modeling approaches:
  - Statistical time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA)
  - Machine learning regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  - Deep learning approaches (LSTM)
- Selected XGBoost as the final model based on superior performance metrics
- Optimized hyperparameters through grid search cross-validation

### Performance Evaluation

- Measured statistical accuracy using RMSE (1.37) and directional accuracy (61.2%)
- Implemented trading simulation to assess practical value
- Compared model-based strategy returns (13.2%) against buy-and-hold (7.5%)
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key predictive factors

## Key Findings

- Technical indicators, particularly the 20-day moving average and RSI, showed strong predictive power
- Volume patterns often preceded significant price movements, confirming their value as leading indicators
- The model performed better in trending markets than in highly volatile or sideways conditions
- Day-of-week effects were present but subtle, with slightly stronger returns on specific days
- XGBoost consistently outperformed other approaches in both directional accuracy and simulated returns
- Market regime detection emerged as a crucial factor for improving prediction accuracy

## Reproduction Instructions

To reproduce the analysis and results from this stock price prediction model:

### Environment Setup

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahan-Daksh/Intellihack_44Below_Task4.git
cd intellihack_44below_task4
```

- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed with the following packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis

#### Data Preparation:

- Place the provided dataset (question4-stock-data.csv) in the data/ directory
- Load the dataset using pandas
- Clean any missing values
- Set the Date as the index

#### Running the Analysis

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/Intellihack_44Below_Task4.ipynb
```

The predictions will be saved as stock_predictions.csv in the output/ directory

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Run the visualization cells to generate:
  - Stock closing price over time plot
  - Daily returns analysis
  - Correlation matrix heatmap
  - Monthly average closing price trend

#### Feature Engineering:

- Create technical indicators including:
  - Moving averages (MA5, MA20, MA50)
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Volatility measures
- Generate time-based features (DayOfWeek, Month, Year)
- Create the target variable (5-day future price)

#### Model Development:

- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Train multiple models:
  - ARIMA(5,1,0) model
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest (n_estimators=100)
  - XGBoost (n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)

#### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and direction accuracy
- Visualize model predictions against actual prices
- Analyze model performance

### Generating Predictions

- The notebook outputs predictions for the test period
- For new predictions, you can use the XGBoost or Random Forest model (which performed best) to forecast future prices

The complete analysis is organized in the notebook with clearly marked sections for each step of the process. Execute cells sequentially to reproduce the entire analysis and results.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

- The model struggles with sudden market events and "black swan" scenarios
- Feature importance varies significantly across different market regimes
- Prediction accuracy decreases during high volatility periods
- Limited lookback window may miss longer-term cyclical patterns

### Future Improvements

- Alternative Data Integration

  - Incorporate news sentiment analysis, macroeconomic indicators, and sector performance

- Market Regime Detection

  - Develop a meta-model to identify current market conditions and apply regime-specific models

- Advanced Feature Engineering

  - Explore non-linear feature combinations and automated feature selection techniques
  - Apply wavelet transforms to capture multi-scale price patterns

- Model Ensembling

  - Create an ensemble of diverse models to improve robustness and performance

- Explainability Tools
  - Implement SHAP values to better understand model decisions in different contexts

The current approach provides a solid foundation for stock price prediction with practical application in trading strategies, while offering clear directions for future refinement.
